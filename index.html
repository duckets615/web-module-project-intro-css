    <h1>Yosemite Park Guide</h1>
    <h2>explore California’s beautiful wilderness.</h2>
    <h2>Always open. Reservations are not available or required to enter the park.</h2>
    
    <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the<br>
       power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.<br>
       <br>
    
       First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but<br> 
       within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient<br>
        giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

    <p>Fire is a natural and essential<br>
      part of Yosemite. We manage fire<br>
      carefully and study how it<br>
      interacts with the park’s<br>
      ecosystems. This blog provides<br>
      updates about fires in Yosemite.<br>
      Check for current fire<br>
      restrictions.</p>

    <p>We strongly recommend that you make
       reservations for lodging, camping, 
       and backpacking. You can pay the 
       park entrance fee upon arrival 
       (there's no need to pay it in 
       advance).</p>
